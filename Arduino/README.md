# LW20 / SF20 Arduino API
## Overview

Platform dependant code for the Arduino.

The Arduino version of the API is a simple wrapper of the lw20api.h file that all other versions of the API use.

Please read the top level README for more information about the LW20 API.

Visit http://www.lightware.co.za for more information about the products we provide.

## Building

The build process here simply aggregates files from the repository into an Arduino library package. You can run the build_release_package.bat file to create a release directory with an LW20 library that is directly loadable by the Arduino IDE.
